								The peerspun project aims into making the Gatech campus transit easier by gathering data from all
								available options and simplifying it into a simple decision - yes or no.
							</span>
						</p>

						<h3>Motivation</h3>

						<span class="ProjectText2">
							<p>
								Most  users  access  nextbus.com  to  get  the
								arrival time of their bus. The bus service itself is not very
								reliable and is subject to constant delays due to traffic,
								among other reasons. In such situations, students must
								walk to  class,  and  are  often late  due to  waiting then
								eventually being forced to walk. Our initial user surveys
								show that delays  in the trolley  service  ranked  as the
								most frustration-inducing aspect of navigation around
								our campus. Our team’s system will help bridge these
								gaps in  intra-college transit by notifying users about
								trolley delays and suggesting to them nearby viaCycle
								stations along with their availability.

							</div>

							<p>In this project we went through the process of Interviews, Surveys, Designing Alternatives,
							Design Presentation, Protyping and User Evaluation.</p>

							<h3>Evaluation Summary</h3>
							<p>
								Users  were  routinely  able  to  locate  trolleys,
								buses, and ViaCycle stations. They also had little trouble
								determining  the  closest  ViaCycle  station  with  bikes
								available.  From  this  we  determine  that  the  transit
								option markers worked effectively. Since the
								participants  had  such  difficulty  with  the  decision
								screen,  an  integral  element  of  the  system's  core
								functionality, a clearer or alternate means of exiting the
								decision  screen  should  be  made  available.  The  AR
								aspect  of the  interface  was met  with  praise from  all
								participants,  and  was  also  quite  easily  adapted  to
								throughout the cognitive walkthrough task trials.

					<h1>ROSS API</h1>
					<div class="Information">
						<p>
							<span class="ProjectText1">
								The Responsive Objects, Surfaces and Spaces (ROSS) Application Programming Interface (API) is a way for applications
								to run across a variety of tangible platforms tabletop computers, touch-screen mobile devices, responsive walls, and
								interactive 3D spaces.
							</span>
						</p>
						<h3>The Goal</h3>
						<span class="ProjectText2">
							<p>
								The goal of the ROSS API is to simplify the complicated communication problems between new Tangible User Interfaces
								(TUIs) that researchers and developers have built and continue to build. These new TUIs often have new sensing,
								actuation, and display technologies that require significant programming efforts to communicate with other TUIs.
							</p>

								<img class="ProjectImage3" src="./images/Projects/ROSS/2.png"/>
								<img class="ProjectImage3" src="./images/Projects/ROSS/3.png"/>
							</div>
							<p>
								The ROSS API is designed to allow devices that are very different but have common interactions communicate with
								each other. The API's nested structure makes interaction visible between various software levels. The core of the
								ROSS API rests on the notion that the different objects, surfaces and spaces in a responsive environment can exist
								in nested relationships with respect to one another.
