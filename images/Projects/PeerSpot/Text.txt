The peerspun project aims into making the Gatech campus transit easier by gathering data from all 
available options and simplifying it into a simple decision - yes or no.

Motivation
Most  users  access  nextbus.com  to  get  the 
arrival time of their bus. The bus service itself is not very 
reliable and is subject to constant delays due to traffic, 
among other reasons. In such situations, students must 
walk to  class,  and  are  often late  due to  waiting then 
eventually being forced to walk. Our initial user surveys 
show that delays  in the trolley  service  ranked  as the 
most frustration-inducing aspect of navigation around 
our campus. Our team’s system will help bridge these 
gaps in  intra-college transit by notifying users about 
trolley delays and suggesting to them nearby viaCycle 
stations along with their availability.

Conclusion:
Users  were  routinely  able  to  locate  trolleys, 
buses, and ViaCycle stations. They also had little trouble 
determining  the  closest  ViaCycle  station  with  bikes 
available.  From  this  we  determine  that  the  transit 
option markers worked effectively. Since the
participants  had  such  difficulty  with  the  decision 
screen,  an  integral  element  of  the  system's  core 
functionality, a clearer or alternate means of exiting the 
decision  screen  should  be  made  available.  The  AR 
aspect  of the  interface  was met  with  praise from  all 
participants,  and  was  also  quite  easily  adapted  to 
throughout the cognitive walkthrough task trials.
